# Cheap-Achieve
A card game. Check it out on: https://tbbm.itch.io/

Most of the sprites were made using https://www.piskelapp.com/, but some were from Google due to limited time.

"Sand Spear" was made through https://flat.io/. "Coconut Mall" was downloaded from DeoxysPrime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY7SxnKqMmE.

All code was written by me.

The game was inspired by Luck be a Landlord.

The game is not finished and has many bugs (although uncommon), but I won't be working on this for quite a while if ever.
